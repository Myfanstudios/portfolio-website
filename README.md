My DEV1001 Portfolio Website
# Simon Lee – Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal web developer portfolio – a fully hand-coded website built with semantic HTML5 and modern CSS (no frameworks, no shortcuts).

This site is designed to showcase who I am, where I’ve been, and what I can do across web development, safety leadership, and digital advocacy.

## What's Inside

- **Home** – clean intro, site preview, and featured projects.
- **About** – a deeper look at my journey, skills, and work history (from soldier to full-stack developer).
- **Projects** – breakdown of key projects, including kiosks, veterans’ charity, and custom digital products.
- **Contact** – form, social media links, and direct email (yes, it works visually – not functional on purpose).

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 – all semantic, accessibility tags used properly (headers, sections, alt tags, nav, etc.)
- CSS3 – flexbox, grid, media queries, keyframe animations
- No frameworks (no Bootstrap, no jQuery)
- Fully responsive across mobile and desktop

##  Notes

- I’ve added hover animations and glowing icon effects to bring it to life.
- Social - Added via Awesome Icons
- Fonts - Added Google Fonts
- Links - linked to my other sites sites
- Badge - Interactive Badge with ixploding logo (a bit of fun, but omg hard to get right)
- Footer  is interactive – menu link and social.
- Contact form is static – no backend (by design, per assessment brief).

Proudly built by hand, no templates, just code and a strong long black and probably more hours than it should.

##  Notes

Late submission, this was due to having many issue and just took me longer to figure them all out by the time is was due, i still had many issue, i wanted to submit the document right, so thank you
